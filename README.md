# Hello everyone!

My name is Adela Salma Nadhifa.

I am a fresh graduate from Dian Nuswantoro University currently working as Application Developer at GS Battery Indonesia Plant Semarang.

I am a Google Certified Associate Android Developer on November 2022 and also a Bangkit 2022 Graduate in Mobile Development Path!

Here in my GitHub Repository, you can see my struggle-and-tears ( :D ) from the thesis coding, backend_elakip (https://github.com/adelasn14/backend_elakip), through my Bangkit 2022 capstone project, Braindiction (https://github.com/adelasn14/BrainDiction), and some of my other projects.
